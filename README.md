# 47Project Framework — Ultimate Pack

This zip contains the *single-source* reference docs and starter artifacts for the 47Project Framework (Nexus shell), including:
- Master Plan A–Z
- Module Manifest Schema (embedded in examples)
- Settings UI Binding Spec v1
- Plan Canonicalization & Hashing Spec v1
- Offline `.47bundle` spec
- Capability Catalog v1
- Example module manifests (AppSCrawler, IdentityKit, HelloModule)
- Example plan
- Your current AppCrawler PowerShell scripts (as provided in the project)

## Suggested next step
Use these docs as the locked contract before coding the final version.

## Notes
- Replace `<YOUR_CERT_THUMBPRINT>` when you define signing.
- In v1, signatureRequired may be relaxed; in Managed/Locked modes it should be true.
