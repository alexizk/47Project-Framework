# Contributing

This project is currently maintained as an internal "ultimate pack".

## Suggested workflow
1. Create a feature branch
2. Keep changes small and scoped
3. Update:
   - docs (docs/INDEX.md + relevant pages)
   - CHANGELOG (docs/CHANGELOG.md)
   - dist_manifest.json (regenerated by release step)
4. Run basic checks (Windows):
```powershell
pwsh -NoLogo -NoProfile -File Framework/47Project.Framework.ps1 -Help
pwsh -NoLogo -NoProfile -File 47Project.Framework.GUI.v13.ps1
```

## Style
- PowerShell 7+
- StrictMode friendly
- Avoid Windows-only APIs unless guarded

## Security
If you find a security issue, report it privately.
