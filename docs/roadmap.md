# Roadmap (small + realistic)

Identity Kit is intentionally **not** a full system “tweaker”.

---

## Non-goals

- turning it into an “all settings” optimizer
- background services/agents
- permanent telemetry/monitoring components

---

## Small improvements (allowed scope)

- more tooltips and UI hints
- better OS/edition detection
- clearer “reboot required” messaging
- stronger portability (no hard-coded paths)
- more reliable lock screen refresh strategies (still best-effort)

---

## Nice-to-have (only if it stays simple)

- export/import profile bundles (json + images)
- “copy diagnostics” one-click button (Windows build + badges + log excerpt)
