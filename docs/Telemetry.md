# Telemetry (Opt-in)

Telemetry is **off by default**.

## Local telemetry
When enabled, the framework records local metrics (no upload):
- command usage counts
- durations (doctor, plan runs)
- error category counts

Stored under the framework data directory. Support bundles exclude telemetry by default.
