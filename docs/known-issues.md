# Known Issues / Limitations

This is a reality list — not failures of the tool.

---

## Lock screen may need reboot
Enforced/system methods often require reboot due to caching and SystemData behavior.

## Lock screen can be overridden
Managed devices or local policy may force a specific lock screen.

## Some toggles are Windows-build dependent
Taskbar/Explorer toggles can change name/behavior across Windows updates.

## Non-admin mode is limited
Some actions are best-effort without Admin and may not apply.

## Compatibility notes

Some toggles depend on your Windows build/edition and may change behavior across updates. This is expected.
